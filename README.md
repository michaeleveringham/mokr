# âœˆ mokr

Remote web browser automation.

## About

`mokr` is a spirtual successor to [`pyppeteer`](https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer),
which it was originally forked from. However, `mokr` isn't meant to be a 1:1 drop-in
replacement for it, and also doesn't seek to keep parity with
[`puppeteer`](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer).

Some functionality has remained the same, but a lot has changed, too.
Some elements have been based off of `puppeteer`
proper and [`python-playwright`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python), too.

`mokr` is named after [MOCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center), Nasa's
Mission Operation Control Rooms that were used to control launches.

## Quickstart

Run `pip install mokr` to install package.

Run `mokr install` to install browsers.

Run `mokr scrape <url>` to load the target page and dump contents to console.

## Documentation

See the full [documentation](https://mokr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Usage

Launch a headless browser, navigate to a site, and dump the html to console.
```python
import asyncio
from mokr import launch

async def main():
    async with launch() as browser:
        page = await browser.first_page()
        response = await page.goto("https://example.com")
        content = await response.content()
        print(content)
    
asyncio.run(main())
```

Launch a headful browser, hook some handlers to handle requests and responses,
and navigate to the Wikipedia page for Python. Use the handlers to intercept the
Python logo, make a new request for a picture of a python snake, and fulfill the
original request with it.
```python
import asyncio
from mokr import launch
from mokr.network import Request, Response

async def main():
    snake_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Python_molurus_molurus_2.jpg"
    async with launch(headless=False) as browser:
        page = await browser.first_page()

        async def intercept_request(request: Request) -> Request | None:
            print(f"Intercepted request for: {request.url}")
            if request.url.endswith("Python-logo-notext.svg.png"):
                print("Getting a cute python picture to use as the new logo...")
                response = await page.fetch(snake_url)
                await request.fulfill(response)
            else:
                return request

        def log_response(response: Response) -> Request:
            print(f"Got {response.status} from: {response.url}")
        
        page.on("request", intercept_request)
        page.on("response", log_response)
        await page.goto("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Notable Changes from Pyppeteer

While forked from `pyppeteer`, there are some notable changes beyond reformating,
refactoring, and restructuring! Including, but not limited to...

Changed:
  - The `NetworkManager` has been overhauled. The new Chrome implementation is based off of
  `puppeteer` heavily, but is not 1:1 with it. It uses the
  [fetch domain](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Fetch/) instead
  of just the [network domain](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Network/).
  - Request interception is enabled by default. Can be disabled with 
  `Page.set_request_interception_enabled(False)` (on Chrome, Firefox is always on).
  - `Browser.create` has been replaced with `Browser.ready` and accepts no keyword arguments.
  This means a `Browser` can be instantied and target discovery postponed until
  `.ready()` is called.
  - The `launch` method is top-level and offers an async context manager to better handle
  graceful exits.
  - Firefox only: Temporary extensions can be installed at browser launch.
  - `CDPSession` is now `DevtoolsSession` and shares a base class with `Connection`,
  called `RemoteConnection`.

New:
  - Partial Firefox support.
  - There is a new class, `FetchDomain` that can be used to send fetch requests
  via `Page.fetch` (this calls the page's instantiated `FetchDomain` object).
  - Another new class, `HttpDomain` is available to send ad hoc requests via an
  `httpx`, HTTP2-enabled, client that syncs it's cookies with the parent `Page` and
  vice-versa.
  - Proxy support is baked-in, meaning you can pass a `proxy` string to `mokr.launch` directly.
  - New `EventWaiter` class; based off of `pyppeteer.helper.waitForEvent` method.

Removed:
  - Tracing has been removed.
  - `ElementHandle.querySelectorEval` and `.querySelectorAllEval` have been removed.

## Compared to...

Huge thanks are owed to the contributors of all the below projects, without them,
this project would be quite different.

The disadvantages below are not a knock on any of these projects or their contributors.

## To Do

- Finish/publish tests.
- Fully support Firefox. Currently only a subset of CDP is implemented in Firefox, so functionality is lacking. While
[BiDi](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webdriver-bidi) is in development, it is not certain when it will be feature-complete.
There are a few options here:
  - [puppeteer is tracking](https://puppeteer.github.io/ispuppeteerwebdriverbidiready/) their own progress. Could wait for this
  to be closer to parity and port it.
  - Another option would be to port off the implementation Microsoft has done, since [they will not be abandoning their custom Firefox distribution for BiDi anytime soon](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/24073#issuecomment-1636205254). This would create an abtract dependency, though.
  - A third option would be to use temporary extensions to mimic as much behaviour as possible. We could already potentially use the
  [webRequest API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest) to intercept, abort, and alert requests.
  Though the `Runtime.addBinding` CDP method is not implemented in Firefox so it can be difficult to callback to Python methods
  in a blocking manner.
- Explore decorating `Page.wait_for_<x>` methods with `contextlib.asynccontextmanager`
so the syntax is more straightforward.
