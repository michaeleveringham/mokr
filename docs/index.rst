âœˆ mokr
======

Welcome to the documentation for mokr!

`mokr` is a spirtual successor to :pyppeteer:`pyppeteer`,
which it was originally forked from. However, `mokr` isn't meant to be a 1:1 drop-in
replacement for it, and also doesn't seek to keep parity with
:puppeteer:`puppeteer`.

Some functionality has remained the same, but a lot has changed, too.
Some elements have been based off of :puppeteer:`puppeteer`
proper and :microsoft:`python-playwright`, too.

`mokr` is named after `MOCR <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center>`_,
Nasa's Mission Operation Control Rooms that were used to control launches.
